RAST(1)                                                   RAST(1)


NAME
       rast - translate output of sgmls to RAST format

SYNOPSIS
       rast [ -ooutput_file ] [ input_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rast  translates  the  output  of sgmls to the format of a
       RAST result.  RAST is the Reference Application  for  SGML
       Testing defined in the Proposed American National Standard
       on Conformance Testing  for  Standard  Generalized  Markup
       Language  (SGML)  Systems  (X3.190-199X).  Rast reads from
       input_file or from standard input  if  input_file  is  not
       specified.  It writes to output_file or to standard output
       if output_file is not specified;  use  of  the  -o  option
       avoids the need for rast to use a temporary file.

       Note  that  the -c option of sgmls can generate a capacity
       report in RACT format.

BUGS
       Production [9] in clause 14.5.5 of the draft  standard  is
       clearly  wrong;  rast corrects it by appending `, LE'.  An
       alternative way to correct  it  would  be  to  delete  the
       `,"END-ENTITY"'.

       In production [18] in clause 14.5.9, `markup data+' should
       be `markup data*' since internal sdata entities  need  not
       contain  any  characters (14.5.11), and markup data cannot
       be empty (14.5.9, 14.5.12).

       The RAST result for the example in Annex B.4 is incorrect.
       The  line G03-A1= should be immediately followed by a line
       !g03-e1!.  (The problem with production [9]  also  applies
       to this example.)

       Rast outputs a newline after #ERROR in order to avoid pro-
       ducing files with partial lines.
