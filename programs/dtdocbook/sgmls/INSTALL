This file describes how to install sgmls.

UNIX
----

Look at the Makefile and edit it if necessary.

Do `make config.h'.  This runs a shell script that generates an
appropriate config.h file from unix.cfg.  If this works, have a look
at config.h and make sure it's correct.  (In particular you might want
to change the definition of DEFAULT_PATH.)  If this doesn't work, copy
unix.cfg to config.h, and then edit config.h yourself; please also
tell me what went wrong.

Do `make'.

If you like, do `make test' to run some tests.

Do `make install' to install the binaries.

If you like, do `make install.man' to install the man pages.

MS-DOS with Borland C++ 2.0
---------------------------

Rename makefile to makefile.ux and then rename makefile.bcc to
makefile.

Copy dos.cfg to config.h.

Look at config.h and makefile and edit them if you want.

Do `make -S'.

Copy sgmls.exe and sgmlsasp.exe to a directory that's on your path.

VAX/VMS
-------

Copy vms.cfg to config.h.

Look at Makefile.vms and config.h and edit them if you want.

Use the script in Makefile.vms to build sgmls and sgmlsasp.

VM/CMS
------

[This configuration is untested.]

Copy cms.cfg to config.h.

Use Makefile.cms to build sgmls and sgmlsasp.
