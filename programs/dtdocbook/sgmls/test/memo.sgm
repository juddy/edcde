With SGML, "What You See Isn't All You Get"

Dear Keith,

This memo is being written to demonstrate the power and simplicity of
the SGML markup minimization and WYSIWYG support.

Although only one tag is visible in the document (to identify an optional
"carbon copy" recipient), the SGML parser recognizes 15 different
element types.  This allows each element to be formatted differently;
for example, the start and end of a quotation can have differing
curved quotation marks (the normal typesetting convention), even though
identical straight quotation marks were used as the WYSIWYG entry convention.

Yours truly,

Charles F. Goldfarb
