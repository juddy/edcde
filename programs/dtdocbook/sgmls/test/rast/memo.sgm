|Dear Keith,|
[/P]
[P]
|This memo is being written to demonstrate the power and simp|
|licity of|
#RE
|the SGML markup minimization and WYSIWYG support.|
[/P]
[P]
|Although only one tag is visible in the document (to identif|
|y an optional|
#RE
[Q]
|carbon copy|
[/Q]
| recipient), the SGML parser recognizes 15 different|
#RE
|element types.  This allows each element to be formatted dif|
|ferently;|
#RE
|for example, the start and end of a quotation can have diffe|
|ring|
#RE
|curved quotation marks (the normal typesetting convention), |
|even though|
#RE
|identical straight quotation marks were used as the WYSIWYG |
|entry convention.|
