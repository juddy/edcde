SGMLSASP(1)                                           SGMLSASP(1)


NAME
       sgmlsasp - translate output of sgmls using ASP replacement
       files

SYNOPSIS
       sgmls [-n] replacement_file...

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlsasp translates the standard input using the  specifi-
       cation  in  replacement_file...   and writes the result to
       the standard output.  The standard input must  be  in  the
       format  output by sgmls.  Each replacement file must be in
       the format of an Amsterdam SGML parser  (ASP)  replacement
       file;  this  format is described in the ASP documentation.
       Duplicate  replacements  are  silently  ignored.   The  -n
       option  disables  upper-case  substitution  (folding)  for
       names in replacement files; this  option  should  be  used
       with concrete syntaxes that do not specify upper-case sub-
       stitution for general names (that is, names that  are  not
       entity names).

BUGS
       References  to  external data entities are ignored.  (Sup-
       port for external data  entities  is  not  implemented  in
       ASP.)
