Stuff to do:

    Add param to _nchild - gi.		??

    Tables

	Consider having _osftable do the entire table, just calling it
	for each call and row.

	More work on tables, in general.  (try more test more cases, etc.)

	Document _osftable special variable better.

    Use message catalogs.

    Investigate translating StartText/EndText escapes (\n, etc.) as they are
    read, not when processing.

    Keep a list of SpecID's.  Right now we search all specs in FindSpecByID().

    a test suite

    PI mapping - document how it works

    faster trans spec lookup (hash buckets?)

    Info option:
	in summary, total and avg char data in for each elem type

    when malloc'ing structs of a linked list, do N structures at a shot?
