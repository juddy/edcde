This directory and its subdirectories contain the sources for
dtdocbook, the DocBook to SDL converter.

The directories here are:

    doc2sdl

	docbook.cmap - character mappings, used by "instant"
	docbook.tcl  - Tcl code for conversion actions, used by "instant"
	docbook.ts   - translation spec to be read by "instant"
	docbook.tss  - base SDL style sheet (augmented by docbook.tcl)
	dtdocbook    - the driver script for the dtdocbook passes
       *catalog.sh   - a script to build symbolic links to PUBLIC ids
       *env.csh      - csh code to be sourced to set environment vars
       *env.sh       - sh/ksh code to be sourced to set environment vars

       [The files with an asterisk are to be modified to customize the
	environment of dtdocbook for a particular system and directory
	structure.  See the files themselves for comments regarding
	their modification.]

    instant

       [C source code for the program "instant" which reads the output
	of sgmls (the element structure information set, or ESIS),
	builds a tree structure from that output and provides a set of
	commands to walk that tree and emit text or interpret the code
	in docbook.tcl to accomplish the DocBook to SDL conversion.
	The program "instant" will be called by dtdocbook passing it a
	set of commands in the file docbook.ts (translation
	specification).]

    lib

       tptregexp

	    [A regular expression parser library to be linked into
	    "instant".]

	sgml

	    docbook.2.2.1.dtd - the document type definition for DocBook
	    docbook.sgml      - an SGML declaration for DocBook
	    iso-box.gml       - ISO box and line drawing entities
	    iso-dia.gml       - ISO diacritical marks
	    iso-grk1.gml      - ISO greek alphabet 1
	    iso-grk3.gml      - ISO greek alphabet 3
	    iso-lat1.gml      - ISO latin 1 alphabet
	    iso-lat2.gml      - ISO latin 2 alphabet
	    iso-num.gml       - ISO numeric entities
	    iso-pub.gml       - ISO publishing entities
	    iso-tech.gml      - ISO technical entities

	    [The contents of this directory are provided for
	     convenience during the snapshot only.  These files will
	     eventually be put in a location common to both dtinfo and
	     dtdocbook.]

    sgmls

	[C source code for the program "sgmls", an SGML parser.]

    tcl

	[C source code for the Tool Command Language (Tcl) library,
	 libtcl.a, to be linked into "instant".]
