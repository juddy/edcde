 *  GetStandardProperties -
 *
 *
 *  Description: returns information about the specified window
 *  -----------
 *
 *  Inputs:
 *  ------
 *  window = window for which we are getting properties
 * 
 *  Outputs:
 *  -------
 *  argv = data returned from WM_COMMAND property (to restart client)
 *  argc = number of arguments returned from WM_COMMAND property
 *  clientMachine = which machine is client running on
 *  xsmpClient = True if the client is XSMP and False otherwise
 *  screen = window's screen number
 *
 *  Comments:
 *  --------
 *  All X (except GetWMHints) were not available until R4 and therefore have
 *  R4 or greater dependencies.
 *
 *  BEWARE OF THESE ROUTINES:  The XGetWindowProperty routine returns 0 if
 *  it succeeds.  These routines (which were derived from XGetWindowProperty
 *  return 0 if they FAIL.
