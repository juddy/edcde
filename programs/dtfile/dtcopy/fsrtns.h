/*
 *  General comments:
 *
 *  The file systems routines below support renaming, moving, copying,
 *  and deleting single files as well as directories.  The operations
 *  check return codes on close, so they are safe to use with AFS.
 *
 *  If the operation failed, the the reason for the failure (errno value)
 *  is returned in *rcP.
 *
 *  The rename, move and copy routines all take a parameter 'replace'
 *  that determines what happens if the target file/directory already
 *  exists: if 'replace' is zero, the routines return an ENOENT error;
 *  if 'replace' is non-zero the routines will replace any existing
 *  files/directories.
 *
 *  The copy and move operations preserve the modified timestamps and
 *  file permissions of the source.  If the calling program is running
 *  as root, file ownership is also preserved.

 *    where source itself is a symbolic link, as well as the case where
 *    source is a directory that contains symbolic links.
