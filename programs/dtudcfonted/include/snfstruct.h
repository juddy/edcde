/*
 * This file describes the Server Natural Font format.
 * SNF fonts are both CPU-dependent and frame buffer bit order dependent.
 * This file is used by:
 *	1)  the server, to hold font information read out of font files.
 *	2)  font converters
 *
 * Each font file contains the following
 * data structures, with no padding in-between.
 *
 *	1)  The XFONTINFO structure
 *		hand-padded to a two-short boundary.
 *		maxbounds.byteoffset is the total number of bytes in the
 *			glpyh array
 *		maxbounds.bitOffset is thetotal width of the unpadded font
 *
 *	2)  The XCHARINFO array
 *		indexed directly with character codes, both on disk
 *		and in memory.
 *
 *	3)  Character glyphs
 *		padded in the server-natural way, and
 *		ordered in the device-natural way.
 *		End of glyphs padded to 32-bit boundary.
 *
 *	4)  nProps font properties
 *
 *	5)  a sequence of null-terminated strings, for font properties
