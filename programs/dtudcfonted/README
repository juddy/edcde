UDC font editor and UDC data exchange utility README


1) Environment

1.1) XLOCALEDIR environment variable

	- If the NLS database ("XLC_LOCALE" files) locates
	in different directory from where specified at building 
	time, set the full path name of the correct directory to
	the XLOCALEDIR environment variable.

1.2) Editable Fonts

	- Currently, only jisx0208 fonts in Japanese locale is 
	defined in NLS database to have UDC. So the dtudcfonted
	will not show the edit view in other locales than Japanese.

	- If the "fonts.list" file exists in the directories showed 
	below, dtudcfonted and dtudcexch read and get directories
	from this file to search fonts.

		/usr/dt/config/
		/usr/dt/config/$LANG
		$DTUDCFONTS/
		$DTUDCFONTS/$LANG

	- If the system place fonts in different directories other
	than listed in this file, you need to add them in it.
