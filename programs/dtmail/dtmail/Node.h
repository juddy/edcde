// Nodes are of critical importance to the MailTool architecture 
// since all classes rely heavily on Nodes.
// It is possible for the client to maintain a list of Nodes for
// each Folder that it is interested in.  Each Folder has a list of
// Nodes, a Node for each Message the Folder's mailfile contains.
// Each Message has a list of Nodes, a Node for each Attachment the 
// Message contains. And so on...
// Nodes are circular lists and the root node is the only one that
// has a "home-p" set to TRUE.  Each Node has a my_previous_node and
// a my_next_node which point to the previous and next nodes in the
// circular list.  Each Node has data which is of type CORBA::ObjRef.
// The data in the Node depends on which level the node exists - 
// Nodes maintained by Folders contain Messages, Nodes maintained by
// Messages contain Attachments, ...
// This implementation of Nodes is abstract enough for *any* CORBA::ObjRef
// to be placed in Nodes.  Hence, it can be easily used or adapted-for-use
// in any other environment requiring its functionality.
// Semantics:
//
// set_homep()			:  Set self to be home-node.
// is_homep()			:  Is self home-node?
// get_home()			:  Traverse through hierarchy until 
//				   home-node is reached.
// set/get_data()		:  Set or get Node's data.
// next(), prev()		:  Go to next (or previous) Node.
// append(), prepend()		:  Append or prepend a Node to self.`
// remove()			:  Remove node from list.  
// destroy()			:  Destroy node, its contents and release objrefs.
