/*
 *
 * The XtArgCollector class is simply a dynamic array of Args.
 * It is useful to build an ArgList to pass as an argument to
 * XtSetValues.  This is a way to collect resources and values
 * over several functions and then finally set them at another
 * point.  This can help prevent multiple redisplays in widgets
 * like XmList which don't have a DisableRedisplay convenience
 * function like XmText.  It's a class for setting resources
 * similar to the following:
 * 	n=0;
 *	XtSetArg (args[n], XmNmarginHeight, 5); n++
 * 	XtSetValues (widget, args, n);
