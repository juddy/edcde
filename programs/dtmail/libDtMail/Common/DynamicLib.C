// The purpose of this function is to map the virtual DynamicLib object
// into a platform specific implementation at compile time. This is
// a fairly ugly process that requires lots of ifdef's based on the
// particular implementation of shared libraries.
//
// Adding a new dynamic library implementation for a platform involves
// two steps:
//
//     	1) Create a new implementation of the DynamicLib object (see
//	   DlDynamicLib.C for an example).
//
//	2) Adding the appropriate ifdef construction step to this function.
