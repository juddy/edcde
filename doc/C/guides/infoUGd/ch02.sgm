<Para>You can move through an information library in several ways. The easiest
way to get started is to view an information library as a collection of
online books. Online books possess features similar to those found in
traditional hardcopy books. For example, online books are organized into
chapters and sections and have tables of contents. Online books also
have features, such as hypertext links, they are not present in hardcopy
books.

<Para>When you start the Information Manager, it displays the Book List
window, showing the information libraries on your system. The Book List
window provides traditional access to the information you want to read
in Information Manager. From the Book List you can open Reading windows
that display the contents of books in an information library.
To always see where you are in an information library, you can set the
Book List to track your location. From the Book List, you can also print
book sections.

<para>When you double-click on the title of a section you want to read, the
Information Manager opens a Reading window that displays the text of the
selected section. From the Reading window, you can read text and access
all other Information Manager functions. Specifically, you can view text
and graphics, print, search, use bookmarks and notes, set preferences,
and get Help.

<Para>To see quickly where you are in the hierarchy of the information
library, you can set the Book List to track your location automatically.

<Para>With automatic tracking turned on, a finger icon in the Book List window
points to the title of the section you are currently reading. As you
move through the information library, the Book List is automatically
updated to show your current location.

<Para>If the current section is subordinate to a section that is not
expanded in the Book List, the finger icon is &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; and
points to the title of the parent section.
</Para>
<Para>To toggle automatic tracking, choose Auto Track from the Options menu
on the Book List window. Automatic tracking is on when Auto Track has a
check mark next to it.

<Para>The Information Manager allows you to use more than one Reading window at
a time. For example, you can hold the text of one window, while
you continue reading through sections in another window. To do this,
click the pushpin in the tool bar of the Reading
window. Clicking the pushpin switches between the pinned and
unpinned state.
</Para>
<Para>If a window is pinned, the Information Manager opens another
Reading window for the next section you access. If a window is
unpinned, the Information Manager updates the current window
with the text of the new section.<IndexTerm><Primary>pushpin</Primary></IndexTerm>
</Para>
<para>When a window is in the pinned state, the pushpin appears in
the upright position with a check mark next to it.

<Note>
<Para>You can also pin Search Results windows. When you pin a Search Results
window, the Information Manager does not replace the results of the
first search with the results of subsequent searches. Instead, new
search results appear in separate Search Results windows.
</Para>
</Note>
<Para>Choose Preferences from the Options menu to specify whether all new
Reading windows will be pinned or unpinned by default. Keep in mind that
to save screen space, you will probably want to limit the number of
windows in use at one time.

plan to follow multiple links.
