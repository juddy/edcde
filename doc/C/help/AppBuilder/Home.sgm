<Title>What App Builder Does</Title>
<Step>
<Para>Application Builder (also called App Builder) provides a simple method
for developers and others to construct applications that integrate
well into the Common Desktop Environment. It provides two basic
services: aid in assembling Motif objects into the desired application
user interface, and generation of appropriate calls to the routines
that support desktop integration services (ToolTalk messaging, drag
and drop, for example).</Para>
<Para>Key supported tasks include:
</Para>
<ItemizedList Mark="&bull;">
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.1">
<Para>Interactive layout of the user interface for an application,
constructing it piece-by-piece from a collection of objects from the
&ProductName; Motif toolkit.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.2">
<Para>Definition of connections between objects to provide elements
of application interface behavior, and a limited test mode that allows
connections to be exercised.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.3">
<Para>Interactive specification of the interconnections desired
between the application and &ProductName; desktop services.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.4">
<Para>Editing of applications previously created using App Builder.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.5">
<Para>Generation of C language source code and associated project
files for the application.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem Id="H.HT.item.6">
<Para>Generation (compilation) and invocation of the application
from within Application Builder, allowing you to execute
the build/run/debug cycle from a common environment (without
having to exit and restart App Builder)</Para>
