 * $XConsortium: dbswab.h /main/2 1996/10/28 14:00:06 drk $
 * July 1996.
 * Header file for all internal vista byte swap modifications.
 * The mods byte swap vista cache pages, dbd tables, etc,
 * to ensure that database files are maintained in a canonical
 * format no matter what machine they are used on.
 * The DtSearch data records are byte swapped in code at the
 * DtSearch level (dtsrswab.c, defns in SearchP.h).
 * Byte swap is performed with the standard htonl, htons, ntohl,
 * and ntohs network conversion functions for byte order neutrality.
 * Canonical integer length is enforced with the typedefs
 * LONG and INT in vista.h
 * The external database files are in big-endian ("network") order.
 * So that they can be defined as "null" macros on big endian machines,
 * new functions (1) always byte swap in place, and (2) always succeed.
 *
 * An #include "vista.h" and #include "dbtype.h" must precede this include.
