/******************** BOOLPARS.H ********************
 * $Id: boolpars.h /main/1 1996/03/29 17:03:47 cde-ibm $
 * February 1996.
 * Header for boolpars.c AusText/DtSearch yacc-based boolean query parser.
 *
 * FORMAT OF TRUTH TABLE:
 * Pointer to TRUTHTAB struct is main yacc stack value.
 * Represents 256 unsigned chars, every possible permutation of 8 (max)
 * query stems.  The unsigned chars ("permutes") are bit vectors.
 * Bit #0 (lowest order) is for first word in stemsarray stems[0],
 * bit #1 is stems[1], etc.
 * Example: truthtab for query consisting of a single word,
 * 	call it 'A' (assigned bit #0), is the 128 chars 1, 3, 5, 7, ...,
 * 	ie all bitvector permutations with low order bit turned on.
 * B:      (bit #1) is the 128 chars 2, 3, 6, 7, ..., ie all permutations
 * 	   with 2nd bit turned on.
 * A & B:  Intersection of truth tables: the 64 chars 3, 7, ...,
 * 	   all the bit vector permutations they have in common.
 * A | B:  Union of truth tables:  the 192 permutes 1,2,3, 5,6,7, 9,10,11...
 * ~B:     Complement of truth table, U - B: the 128 chars 0, 1, 4, 5, ...,
 * 	   ie every bitvector permutation NOT in B.
 * 
 * The zero permute (all bits zero) refers to the entire
 * balance of the database containing none of the query stems.
 * Needless to say searches with the zero permute in their
 * truth table will take an incredibly long time!
 *
 * The 'universal set' U is all 256 possible permutes.
 * The 'empty set' is indicated by truthtab.pmsz == 0;
 *
 * The permutes in a truth table are maintained in
 * ascending order for ease of comparisons.
 *
 * Truth table manipulations require and depend on
 * DtSrMAX_STEMCOUNT being defined only as 8.
 *
 * Newly allocated truth tables are maintained on the 'ttlist'
 * using the 'next' field.  This is to ensure they are eventually
 * freed to prevent memory leaks.
 *
 * If 'stemno' >= 0 it points to the word in usrblk.stems to which
 * it applies.  Stemno == -1 means truth table is not directly
 * associated with a word in usrblk.stems.
