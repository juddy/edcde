 * Removes trailing whitespace from a character buffer 
 * (such as a line read in with fgets).
 * If the last char in the original buffer was \n, 
 * then the last char in the resulting string will be \n.
 * Replaces all internal control and extended graphics
 * characters (except the last \n) with a blank.
 * Does nothing to empty strings ("\0") and strings
 * beginning with a form feed ("\f....").
 * All Conversions are done inplace, i.e. within 
 * the same buffer passed to the function.
