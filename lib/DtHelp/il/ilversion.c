        The above version string *must* maintain the syntax and position of all fields
        before the ";".  The strings have the following format; each string is 5 chars:
            nnnnn       A 5 char fixed string equal to "HP IL ".
            vvvvvv      A 6 char string in the format "v!!.??", where !! is the two-digit
                        major version number (" n" if less than 10), and ?? is the minor
                        version number ("n " if less than 10).  Examples: "v10.12",
                        "v 9.6 ".
            bbbbb       A 4 char string in the format "bl??", where ?? is the baselevel
