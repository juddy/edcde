 *++
 *  PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *	DtMrmInitialize must be called in order to prepare an application to
 *	use URM widget fetching facilities for CDE Dt widgets.  It is 
 *	analogous to the MrmInitialize routine for Motif widgets.
 *
 *	DtMrmInitialize initializes the internal data
 *	structures (creating the mapping from class codes to the creation
 *	routine for each builtin widget class) which URM needs in order to 
 *	successfully perform type conversion on arguments, and successfully 
 *	access widget creation facilities. DtMrmInitialize must be called before
 *	any widgets are	created, whether by URM's fetch mechanisms or directly
 *	by the application. It may be called before or after XtInitialize, and
 *	multiple calls after the first one are benign (no-ops).
