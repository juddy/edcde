/* These two globals are needed for the following macros to work.
 * The definitions are neither "extern" nor "static".  This keeps both
 * C and C++ from complaining about unused variables, keeps the linker
 * from complaining about multiply-defined symbols, and creates only a
 * single instance of each var per program (rather than one per *.o).
 * This is also why both variables are uninitialized arrays.
 *
 * These macros imitate the original HP NLS16 equivalents so that rest
 * of the Codelibs code does not need to be modified.  The original
 * definitions are below within the "#ifdef NLS16" section.
 *
 * The original HP NLS16 assumes 2 byte multi-byte characters. It is
 * generalized for all multi-byte characters.
