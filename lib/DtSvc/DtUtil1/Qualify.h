 * _DtQualifyWithFirst
 *
 * takes:   an unqualified filename like foo.txt, and
 *          a colon-separated list of pathnames, such as 
 *                /etc/dt:/usr/dt/config
 *
 * returns: a fully qualified filename.  Space for the filename
 *          has been allocated off the heap using malloc.  It is 
 *          the responsibility of the calling function to dispose 
 *          of the space using free.
 *
 * example: ...
 *          char * filename;
 *          ...
 *          filename = _DtQualifyWithFirst("configFile",
 *                          "/foo/first/location:/foo/second/choice");
 *          < use filename >
