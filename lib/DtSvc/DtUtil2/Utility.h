/******************************************************************************
 *
 * _DtVectorizeInPlace() takes a string which is made up a group of
 * components, separated by a common separator character, and breaks
 * the string up into the separate components.  To reduce the amount of
 * memory used (and to reduce memory fragmentation), the string is simply
 * searched for each occurrence of the separator, and the separator is then
 * replaced by a NULL character.  Pointers to the individual components are
 * returned as a NULL-terminated array of pointers.
 *
 * The passed-in string should be malloc'ed space, since the string will
 * eventually be freed when the application frees the returned array.  If
 * you don't want the original string modified, then a copy should be made,
 * before calling this function.
 *
 * The application is responsible for freeing up this memory, and should do
 * so by calling _DtFreeStringVector().
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *      string           A NULL-terminated string, which is to be vectorized.
 *
 *      separator        The character which separates the components within
 *                       the string.

 *****************************************************************************
 *
 * _DtCmdStringToArrayOfStrings - takes a string and an array of pointers
 *   to strings and breaks the string into whitespace separated words.
 *
 *   A "word" is a sequence of characters that has no whitespace with
 *   the following exception:
 *
 *     -  A word may contain contain whitespace if it is delimited
 *        by a pair of matching single or double qotes.
 *
 *   "Whitespace" is a tab or blank character.
 *
 *
 * NOTES: 
 *
 *   -  The space for the "words" is malloc'd and must be free'd by
 *   the caller.
 *   -	_DtCmdFreeStringVector() should be used to free up string vectors
 *   created by _DtCmdStringToArrayOfStrings().
 *
 *   -  "theArray" is NULL terminated.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *
 *   char theString[];		- The string to parse.
 *
 *   char *theArray[];		- MODIFIED: gets filled with pointers to
 *				  the words that are parsed.
