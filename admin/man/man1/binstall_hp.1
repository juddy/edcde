.SH NAME
binstall_hp \- build environment installation path availability
.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page describes the usage of the build install mechanism at
Hewlett-Packard. The focus is primarily on the default locations for the
install paths.
.TP 0
All build installation paths are available through the 
.I /binstall
directory on all build systems. If you need to set up 
.I /binstall
on a non-build system, examine the symbolic links and nfs mounts in
.IR /binstall . 
.SH
In
.I /binstall
each build tree that has an installed build is listed as a subdirectory.
Each subdirectory under the build tree subdirectory contains an instance
of a build environment for that build tree.  There are 2 types of build
tree subdirectories: automatically generated directories based on
.I mm_dd
(month_date from the
.I date
command) and any specially named subdirectories.  There is also a
symbolic link 
.I latest
which points to the most recent 
.I mm_dd
directory. Using the
.I latest
directory will normally be equivalent to pointing
.I TOP
to a build tree. However, if the build tree is unstable,
.I latest
may be reset to the last stable build.
.SH
Each 
.I mm_dd 
directory has a definite lifespan that depends on the
importance of the tree and the availability of disk space. This
information is stored in 
.IR /binstall/pathlife .
.SH EXAMPLES
Developer's will usually either reset 
.I TOP
to 
.I /binstall/treename/latest
or will set 
.I TOP
to an explicit date ->
.I /binstall/treename/mm_dd.
The advantage of the former is that it allows you to stay in closer
touch to the daily bits. The advantage of the latter is that, for a
popular tree, you can choose a date when a stable build occurs and use that 
date's build until it expires. However, it would be good practice to do
a test build against the latest bits before checking a critical file
in.
.TP 3
.nf
Example 1: Point your clone to the latest directory for /x/cde_hp700_90.
cd to your clone
make TOP=/x/cde_hp700_90/latest Makefile
make Makefiles (optional)
.fi
.TP
.nf 
Example 2: Point your clone to the Jan. 3rd build for /x/cde_hp700_90.
cd to your clone
make TOP=/x/cde_hp700_90/01_03 Makefile
make Makefiles (optional)
.SH PACKAGE INFORMATION
Check the 
.I /binstall 
directory on any build system to scan the available paths.
The duration of mm_dd paths is normally 7 days. For debuggable trees, the
default duration will be 2-4 days. The duration for each set of paths
can be read from the file 
.IR /binstall/pathlife.
The binstall mechanism
was developed by Marc Ayotte,
WTD-CV, Hewlett-Packard.
